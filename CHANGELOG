0.3: Changed commands to always be prototypes, and changed around the SimpleSpringBeanCommand wrapper to instantiate a
new one on every call.  That's what we want, really.
Added a new ThreadDump command that has similar functionality to a kill -3.
0.2: Refactored some classes (pulling ShellFactoryImpl out as BlastShellFactoryImpl and creating the ConsoleFactory
interface, for example) in order to let users override the branding and prompt for their SSH shell.
Fixed the "mvn exec:java" plugin in shell-sample.
0.1: Basics working against Karaf 2.1.3, using Spring:  Ssh access, a basic
Groovy shell, a working "Info" command, other commands from Karaf (grep, cat,
etc.) 
Example of an embedded server available in SampleSshApp.
TODOs and issues: 
Groovy shell uses Groovy's deprecated "InteractiveShell", I'll try to to get the
new Groovysh working in 0.2.
