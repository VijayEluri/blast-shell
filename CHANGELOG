0.1:  Basics working against Karaf 2.1.3, using Spring:  Ssh access, a basic
Groovy shell, a working "Info" command, other commands from Karaf (grep, cat,
etc.) 
Example of an embedded server available in SampleSshApp.
TODOs and issues: 
Groovy shell uses Groovy's deprecated "InteractiveShell", I'll try to to get the
new Groovysh working in 0.2.
