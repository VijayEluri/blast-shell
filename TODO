1.) Split out the Spring-specific bits into submodules. Create helpful factory methods to create a Spring-specific one,
vs. a manually-created one.
2.) Look for places we can remove custom code that isn't necessary anymore
3.) Bugs: some commands aren't working anymore.  The "session" local variable for AbstractAction doesn't seem to be
    visible, even though it should be (??).
    The "--help" option doesn't work for some commands. Anything regarding options doesn't work: passing them,
    retrieving them...
4.) Log a Karaf bug around the ArgumentCompleter (ArrayOutOfBoundsException if there are no ArgumentCompleters
    registered...we got around this by making SimpleSpringBeanCommand an ArgumentCompleter.  That's how Karaf gets
    around it too, with the base BlueprintCommand.
