1.) Split out the Spring-specific bits into submodules. Create helpful factory methods to create a Spring-specific one,
    vs. a manually-created one.
2.) Look for places we can remove custom code that isn't necessary anymore
3.) Bugs: the "session" local variable for AbstractAction doesn't seem to be visible, even though it should be (??).
4.) Log a Karaf bug around the ArgumentCompleter (ArrayOutOfBoundsException if there are no ArgumentCompleters
    registered...we got around this by making SimpleSpringBeanCommand an ArgumentCompleter.  That's how Karaf gets
    around it too, with the base BlueprintCommand.
5.) Figure out authentication: Karaf now comes with a KarafJaasPasswordAuthenticator; perhaps we can interact with that
    and give ourselves a basic JAAS setup?  Would be nice to make it easy for users to plug into some type of auth
    framework they already have.  And people will doubtless want role-based control, which JAAS will provide (and our
    simple password authenticator will not...no authorization included).
6.) Clean up spacing in ThreadDumpAction
