1.) Split out the Spring-specific bits into submodules. Create helpful factory methods to create a Spring-specific one, vs. a manually-created one.
2.) Look for places we can remove custom code that isn't necessary anymore
3.) Bugs: some commands aren't working anymore.  "shell:threads", for example.  Tab-completion not working anywhere.
